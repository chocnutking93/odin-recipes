    <h3>These are the ultimate steakhouse burgers. They are packed with flavor and reliably juicy, even when cooked to well-done.</h3>
    <p> Who doesn't love a big, tender, juicy steakhouse burger? Problem is, they're difficult to replicate at home because most steakhouses 
        blend different cuts of beef-like sirloin, chuck, and short ribs to customize the flavor and fat content of their burgers. It's 
        certainly possible to grind your own meat or ask your butcher for a special blend, but it's not always practical. Fortunately, there's 
        an easier way. By combining ordinary supermarket ground beef with a panade - or mixture of bread and milk - and lots of seasoning, you 
        can make steakhouse-style burgers in no time.</p>

        <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by making the panade. Simply mash the bread and milk together with a fork until it forms a chunky paste.</li>
            <li>Add the seasoning: salt, pepper, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and ketchup.</li>
            <li>Stir well.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and scallions (if using).</li>
            <li>Mix everything together until just combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture into 8 equal portions and shape into balls. Flatten each ball into a 3/4-inch-thick patty thatâ€™s about 4-1/2 inches across. 
                (Keeping the burgers thick ensures a nice char on the outside without overcooking the inside.) To prevent the burgers from forming a domed shape 
                on the grill, create a slight depression in the center of each patty.</li>
            <li>Grill the burgers 2-4 minutes on the first side until nicely browned. Flip and cook on the second side a few minutes more, until desired doneness 
                is reached. (Note: the panade in these burgers keeps the meat tender and juicy, even when overcooked, so these burgers are ideal for kids, the elderly, 
                pregnant women, or anyone else who might prefer their burgers well done.)</li>
